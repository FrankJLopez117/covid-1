The dashboard from hopkins it's great but it needs more drill down capabilites
Plan:
Report all the cases, live update if possible
Narrow down analysis to US
Do a flow or kansey viz of location path
Compare confirmed cases to SARS
Do a timelapse of infection / confirmed cases
Try to get a news feed
